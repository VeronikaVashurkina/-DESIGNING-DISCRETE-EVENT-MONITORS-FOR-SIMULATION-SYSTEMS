# -DESIGNING-DISCRETE-EVENT-MONITORS-FOR-SIMULATION-SYSTEMS
This simulation uses the concept of events. When using the concept of events, it is necessary to describe the modeled system by a variety of types of events {EV1, EV2 ..., EVK} and establish the probabilistic patterns of occurrence of events of each type in time, since the flow of events is chronological. Simulation of the system functioning process is connected with the occurrence of an event of a certain type and the execution of works corresponding to this type of event. The event is modeled using Poisson information flow. We randomly choose one of 5 events, which in turn schedules the time of the next same event.
